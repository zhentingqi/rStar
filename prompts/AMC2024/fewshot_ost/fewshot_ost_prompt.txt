### Instruction:
How many three-digit positive integers $N$ satisfy the following properties?\n\nThe number $N$ is divisible by $7$.\nThe number formed by reversing the digits of $N$ is divisible by $5$.\n\n$\\textbf{(A) } 13 \\qquad \\textbf{(B) } 14 \\qquad \\textbf{(C) } 15 \\qquad \\textbf{(D) } 16 \\qquad \\textbf{(E) } 17$

### Response:
Step 1: The number $N$ is a three-digit number divisible by $7$, and the reverse of $N$, denoted $R$, must be divisible by $5$. This means the last digit of $R$, which is the first digit of $N$, must be $0$ or $5$.
Step 2: Since $N$ is a three-digit number, its first digit cannot be $0$. Therefore, the first digit of $N$ must be $5$, and $N$ has the form $N = 5xy$, where $x$ and $y$ are digits.
Step 3: The reverse of $N = 5xy$ is $R = yx5$, and since $R$ is divisible by $5$, this condition is automatically satisfied because the last digit of $R$ is $5$.
Step 4: The number $N$ must satisfy $100 \cdot 5 + 10x + y = 500 + 10x + y \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$. Simplifying modulo $7$, $500 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}$, $10x \equiv 3x \pmod{7}$, and $y \equiv y \pmod{7}$, the condition becomes $3 + 3x + y \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$.
Step 5: Solving $3 + 3x + y \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$, or $3x + y \equiv -3 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}$, we test all possible $x$ and $y$ values to ensure $N$ remains a three-digit number.
Step 6: Testing for $x = 0$, $3(0) + y \equiv 4 \pmod{7}$ gives $y = 4$, so $N = 504$. For $x = 1$, $3(1) + y \equiv 4 \pmod{7}$ gives $y = 1$, so $N = 511$. For $x = 2$, $3(2) + y \equiv 4 \pmod{7}$ gives $y = 5$, so $N = 525$. For $x = 3$, $3(3) + y \equiv 4 \pmod{7}$ gives $y = 2$, so $N = 532$. For $x = 4$, $3(4) + y \equiv 4 \pmod{7}$ gives $y = 6$, so $N = 546$. For $x = 5$, $3(5) + y \equiv 4 \pmod{7}$ gives $y = 3$, so $N = 553$. For $x = 6$, $3(6) + y \equiv 4 \pmod{7}$ gives $y = 0$, so $N = 560$.
Step 7: The valid numbers $N$ are $504, 511, 525, 532, 546, 553, 560$, totaling 7 numbers. Each $N$ satisfies the conditions that $N$ is divisible by $7$ and the reverse $R$ is divisible by $5$.
Step 8: The answer is C.

### Instruction:
A rhombic dodecahedron is a solid with $12$ congruent rhombus faces. At every vertex, $3$ or $4$ edges meet, depending on the vertex. How many vertices have exactly $3$ edges meet?\n\n$\\textbf{(A) }5\\qquad\\textbf{(B) }6\\qquad\\textbf{(C) }7\\qquad\\textbf{(D) }8\\qquad\\textbf{(E) }9$

### Response:
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: A rhombic dodecahedron is a polyhedron with 12 rhombus faces, 24 edges, and 14 vertices. Each vertex connects 3 or 4 edges.
Step 2: Each rhombus has 2 acute angles (where 3 edges meet) and 2 obtuse angles (where 4 edges meet), contributing 2 vertices of each type. With 12 rhombuses, this gives $12 \times 2 = 24$ vertices of each type before considering overlaps.
Step 3: Type-1 vertices (where 3 edges meet) are shared by 3 rhombuses, and Type-2 vertices (where 4 edges meet) are shared by 4 rhombuses.
Step 4: The total number of unique Type-1 vertices is $3 \times V_1 = 24 \Rightarrow V_1 = \frac{24}{3} = 8$. The total number of unique Type-2 vertices is $4 \times V_2 = 24 \Rightarrow V_2 = \frac{24}{4} = 6$.
Step 5: The total vertex count is $V_1 + V_2 = 8 + 6 = 14$, matching the known total. Thus, there are $V_1 = 8$ vertices where 3 edges meet.
Step 7: The answer is D.

### Instruction:
The line segment formed by $A(1, 2)$ and $B(3, 3)$ is rotated to the line segment formed by $A'(3, 1)$ and $B'(4, 3)$ about the point $P(r, s)$. What is $|r-s|$?\n\n$\\textbf{(A) } \\frac{1}{4} \\qquad \\textbf{(B) } \\frac{1}{2} \\qquad \\textbf{(C) } \\frac{3}{4} \\qquad \\textbf{(D) } \\frac{2}{3} \\qquad \\textbf{(E) } 1$

### Response:
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: To find the center of rotation $P(r, s)$, we first consider the midpoint between $A$ and $A'$, since $P$ must be equidistant from both $A$ and $A'$ to serve as the rotation center. The midpoint of $A(1, 2)$ and $A'(3, 1)$ is $\left(\frac{1+3}{2}, \frac{2+1}{2}\right) = (2, 1.5)$.
Step 2: We also need to check if this midpoint $(2, 1.5)$ satisfies the rotation requirement for points $B(3, 3)$ and $B'(4, 3)$. The midpoint of $B$ and $B'$ is $\left(\frac{3+4}{2}, \frac{3+3}{2}\right) = (3.5, 3)$. 
Step 3: Since these midpoints differ, $P(r, s)$ must lie at the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of $A \rightarrow A'$ and $B \rightarrow B'$.
Step 4: Solving for $P(r, s)$ using the perpendicular bisectors of segments $A \rightarrow A'$ and $B \rightarrow B'$, we find that $P$ has coordinates $(2.5, 2.5)$.
Step 5: Now, we can determine $|r - s|$: $|r - s| = |2.5 - 2.5| = 0$.
Step 6: The answer is E.
