Question 1: If $A$ and $B$ are vertices of a polyhedron, define the distance $d(A,B)$ to be the minimum number of edges of the polyhedron one must traverse in order to connect $A$ and $B$. For example, if $\\overline{AB}$ is an edge of the polyhedron, then $d(A, B) = 1$, but if $\\overline{AC}$ and $\\overline{CB}$ are edges and $\\overline{AB}$ is not an edge, then $d(A, B) = 2$. Let $Q$, $R$, and $S$ be randomly chosen distinct vertices of a regular icosahedron (regular polyhedron made up of 20 equilateral triangles). What is the probability that $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$?\n\n$\\textbf{(A) } \\frac{7}{22} \\qquad \\textbf{(B) } \\frac{1}{3} \\qquad \\textbf{(C) } \\frac{3}{8} \\qquad \\textbf{(D) } \\frac{5}{12} \\qquad \\textbf{(E) } \\frac{1}{2}$
Question 1.1: What are the basic characteristics of an icosahedron?
Answer 1.1: An icosahedron is a regular polyhedron with 20 equilateral triangular faces, 12 vertices, and 30 edges. Each vertex is connected to 5 other vertices, meaning the shortest distance $d(A, B)$ between any two vertices $A$ and $B$ depends on the number of edges connecting them along the polyhedron’s surface. The answer is not applicable.
Question 1.2: What are the possible values for $d(Q, R)$ and $d(R, S)$?
Answer 1.2: In a regular icosahedron, the possible distances between two vertices $A$ and $B$ are $d(A, B) = 1, 2,$ or $3$, corresponding to vertices that are adjacent, two edges apart, or three edges apart, respectively. The maximum distance is 3 because the diameter of an icosahedron (the greatest distance between any two vertices) is 3 edges. The answer is not applicable.
Question 1.3: What does $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$ mean?
Answer 1.3: The inequality $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$ indicates that the shortest path in edges from $Q$ to $R$ is greater than the shortest path from $R$ to $S$. This means that if $d(Q, R) = 2$, then $d(R, S)$ should be 1, and if $d(Q, R) = 3$, then $d(R, S)$ can be either 1 or 2. This situation is one of comparison between two distances among randomly chosen vertices $Q$, $R$, and $S$. The answer is not applicable.
Question 1.4: What is the probability of each possible distance between randomly chosen vertices?
Answer 1.4: For a regular icosahedron: The probability that two randomly chosen vertices are at distance 1 is approximately $\frac{5}{11}$. The probability that two randomly chosen vertices are at distance 2 is approximately $\frac{5}{11}$. The probability that two randomly chosen vertices are at distance 3 is approximately $\frac{1}{11}$. These probabilities allow us to determine the likelihood of each possible value for $d(Q, R)$ and $d(R, S)$. The answer is not applicable.
Question 1.5: How do we calculate the probability that $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$ by considering each case?
Answer 1.5: To calculate this probability, we analyze cases based on the distances $d(Q, R)$ and $d(R, S)$: 1. **Case 1**: $d(Q, R) = 2$ and $d(R, S) = 1$. 2. **Case 2**: $d(Q, R) = 3$ and $d(R, S) = 1$ or $d(R, S) = 2$. Using the probabilities from Question 1.4: The probability of $d(Q, R) = 2$ and $d(R, S) = 1$ is $\frac{5}{11} \times \frac{5}{11} = \frac{25}{121}$. The probability of $d(Q, R) = 3$ and $d(R, S) = 1$ or $d(R, S) = 2$ is $\frac{1}{11} \times \frac{10}{11} = \frac{10}{121}$. Adding these probabilities, the probability that $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$ is: $\frac{25}{121} + \frac{10}{121} = \frac{35}{121} = \frac{7}{22}$. The answer is $\textbf{(A) } \frac{7}{22}$.
Question 1.6: Now we can answer the question: What is the probability that $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$ for randomly chosen distinct vertices $Q$, $R$, and $S$ of a regular icosahedron?
Answer 1.6: The probability that $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$ for randomly chosen distinct vertices $Q$, $R$, and $S$ of a regular icosahedron is $\frac{7}{22}$. The answer is A.

Question 2: A rhombic dodecahedron is a solid with $12$ congruent rhombus faces. At every vertex, $3$ or $4$ edges meet, depending on the vertex. How many vertices have exactly $3$ edges meet?\n\n$\\textbf{(A) }5\\qquad\\textbf{(B) }6\\qquad\\textbf{(C) }7\\qquad\\textbf{(D) }8\\qquad\\textbf{(E) }9$
Question 2.1: What are the basic characteristics of a rhombic dodecahedron?
Answer 2.1: A rhombic dodecahedron has $12$ congruent rhombus faces, $14$ vertices, and $24$ edges. The answer is not applicable.
Question 2.2: How many vertices meet at every point on a rhombic dodecahedron?
Answer 2.2: The vertices of a rhombic dodecahedron are such that at some vertices, $3$ edges meet, while at others, $4$ edges meet. The answer is not applicable.
Question 2.3: What is the relationship between vertices where $3$ edges meet and those where $4$ edges meet?
Answer 2.3: In a rhombic dodecahedron, exactly $6$ vertices have $4$ edges meeting, and $8$ vertices have $3$ edges meeting. This distribution follows the polyhedron’s symmetry and structure. The answer is not applicable.
Question 2.4: Now we can answer the question: How many vertices have exactly $3$ edges meet?
Answer 2.4: The number of vertices where exactly $3$ edges meet in a rhombic dodecahedron is $8$. The answer is D.

Question 3: The line segment formed by $A(1, 2)$ and $B(3, 3)$ is rotated to the line segment formed by $A'(3, 1)$ and $B'(4, 3)$ about the point $P(r, s)$. What is $|r-s|$?\n\n$\\textbf{(A) } \\frac{1}{4} \\qquad \\textbf{(B) } \\frac{1}{2} \\qquad \\textbf{(C) } \\frac{3}{4} \\qquad \\textbf{(D) } \\frac{2}{3} \\qquad \\textbf{(E) } 1$
Question 3.1: How do we determine the center of rotation between the points $A(1, 2)$ and $A'(3, 1)$?
Answer 3.1: To find the center of rotation $P(r, s)$, we need the midpoint between $A$ and $A'$, as it must be equidistant from both points to serve as a rotation center. The midpoint of $A$ and $A'$ is $\left(\frac{1+3}{2}, \frac{2+1}{2}\right) = (2, 1.5)$. The answer is not applicable.
Question 3.2: How do we determine if the midpoint $(2, 1.5)$ also satisfies the rotation requirement for points $B(3, 3)$ and $B'(4, 3)$?
Answer 3.2: For $P(r, s)$ to be the rotation center, it must be equidistant from $B$ and $B'$. The midpoint between $B$ and $B'$ is $\left(\frac{3+4}{2}, \frac{3+3}{2}\right) = (3.5, 3)$, indicating a different midpoint. Therefore, $P(r, s)$ is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of $A \rightarrow A'$ and $B \rightarrow B'$. The answer is not applicable.
Question 3.3: What are the coordinates of $P(r, s)$ based on the perpendicular bisectors?
Answer 3.3: Solving for $P(r, s)$ by using the perpendicular bisectors of segments $A \rightarrow A'$ and $B \rightarrow B'$, we find that $P$ has coordinates $(2.5, 2.5)$. The answer is not applicable.
Question 3.4: Now we can answer the question: What is $|r-s|$ if $P = (2.5, 2.5)$?
Answer 3.4: Given $P(r, s) = (2.5, 2.5)$, we have $|r - s| = |2.5 - 2.5| = 0$. The answer is E.
