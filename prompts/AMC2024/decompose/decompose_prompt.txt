Question 1: How many three-digit positive integers $N$ satisfy the following properties?  
- The number $N$ is divisible by $7$.  
- The number formed by reversing the digits of $N$ is divisible by $5$.  
Question 1.1: What are the three-digit numbers divisible by $7$?  
Answer 1.1: The smallest three-digit number divisible by $7$ is $105$, and the largest is $994$. These numbers form an arithmetic sequence: $105, 112, \dots, 994$.
Question 1.2: How many terms are in this sequence?  
Answer 1.2: Using the formula for the $n$th term of an arithmetic sequence, $a_n = 105 + (n-1) \cdot 7 = 994$, solving gives $n = 128$. So there are $128$ three-digit numbers divisible by $7$.
Question 1.3: What are the possible last digits of a reversed number divisible by $5$?  
Answer 1.3: A number divisible by $5$ must end in $0$ or $5$ after reversing. Thus, $N$ must start with $0$ or $5$ in its reversed form.
Question 1.4: What conditions does this impose on $N$?  
Answer 1.4: For $N$ to start with $5$ or $0$ when reversed, the last digit of $N$ must be $5$. Thus, $N$ must end in $5$.
Question 1.5: How many three-digit numbers divisible by $7$ end in $5$?  
Answer 1.5: Numbers divisible by $7$ and ending in $5$ are $105, 175, 245, \dots, 945$. Using the arithmetic sequence formula, $a_n = 105 + (n-1) \cdot 70 = 945$, solving gives $n = 14$.
Question 1.6: Now we can answer the question: How many such numbers $N$ exist?  
Answer 1.6: There are $14$ three-digit numbers $N$ that satisfy both conditions. The answer is B.

Question 2: A rhombic dodecahedron is a solid with $12$ congruent rhombus faces. At every vertex, $3$ or $4$ edges meet, depending on the vertex. How many vertices have exactly $3$ edges meet?\n\n$\\textbf{(A) }5\\qquad\\textbf{(B) }6\\qquad\\textbf{(C) }7\\qquad\\textbf{(D) }8\\qquad\\textbf{(E) }9$
Question 2.1: How many vertices does a rhombic dodecahedron have?  
Answer 2.1: A rhombic dodecahedron has $14$ vertices.
Question 2.2: How many edges and faces does a rhombic dodecahedron have?  
Answer 2.2: A rhombic dodecahedron has $24$ edges and $12$ rhombus faces.
Question 2.3: How are the vertices classified by the number of edges meeting?  
Answer 2.3: Some vertices have $3$ edges meeting, and others have $4$ edges meeting.
Question 2.4: How many vertices have $4$ edges meeting?  
Answer 2.4: A rhombic dodecahedron has $6$ vertices where $4$ edges meet.
Question 2.5: How many vertices have $3$ edges meeting?  
Answer 2.5: The remaining $14 - 6 = 8$ vertices have $3$ edges meeting.
Question 2.6: Now we can answer the question: How many vertices have exactly $3$ edges meet?  
Answer 2.6: The number of vertices with exactly $3$ edges meeting is $8$. The answer is D.

Question 3: The line segment formed by $A(1, 2)$ and $B(3, 3)$ is rotated to the line segment formed by $A'(3, 1)$ and $B'(4, 3)$ about the point $P(r, s)$. What is $|r-s|$?\n\n$\\textbf{(A) } \\frac{1}{4} \\qquad \\textbf{(B) } \\frac{1}{2} \\qquad \\textbf{(C) } \\frac{3}{4} \\qquad \\textbf{(D) } \\frac{2}{3} \\qquad \\textbf{(E) } 1$
Question 3.1: What is the midpoint of the line segment $AB$?  
Answer 3.1: The midpoint of $A(1, 2)$ and $B(3, 3)$ is $\left(\frac{1+3}{2}, \frac{2+3}{2}\right) = (2, 2.5)$.  
Question 3.2: What is the midpoint of the line segment $A'B'$?  
Answer 3.2: The midpoint of $A'(3, 1)$ and $B'(4, 3)$ is $\left(\frac{3+4}{2}, \frac{1+3}{2}\right) = (3.5, 2)$.  
Question 3.3: What is the center of rotation $P(r, s)$?  
Answer 3.3: The center of rotation is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of $AB$ and $A'B'$. Solving the perpendicular bisectors, we find $P(r, s) = (2.5, 2.5)$.  
Question 3.4: What are the coordinates of $P(r, s)$?  
Answer 3.4: The coordinates of $P(r, s)$ are $r = 2.5$ and $s = 2.5$.
Question 3.5: Now we can answer the question: What is $|r-s|$ if $P = (2.5, 2.5)$?
Answer 3.5: Given $P(r, s) = (2.5, 2.5)$, we have $|r - s| = |2.5 - 2.5| = 0$. The answer is E.
