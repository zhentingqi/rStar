Question 1: If $A$ and $B$ are vertices of a polyhedron, define the distance $d(A,B)$ to be the minimum number of edges of the polyhedron one must traverse in order to connect $A$ and $B$. For example, if $\overline{AB}$ is an edge of the polyhedron, then $d(A, B) = 1$, but if $\overline{AC}$ and $\overline{CB}$ are edges and $\overline{AB}$ is not an edge, then $d(A, B) = 2$. Let $Q$, $R$, and $S$ be randomly chosen distinct vertices of a regular icosahedron (regular polyhedron made up of 20 equilateral triangles). What is the probability that $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$?
Question 1.1: What are the basic properties of an icosahedron?  
Answer 1.1: A regular icosahedron has 12 vertices, 30 edges, and each vertex is connected to 5 others. Distances between vertices can be 1, 2, or 3 edges.
Question 1.2: What does $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$ mean?  
Answer 1.2: It means the number of edges connecting $Q$ and $R$ is greater than the number of edges connecting $R$ and $S$.
Question 1.3: What are the probabilities of each possible distance between two vertices?  
Answer 1.3: The probability of $d(A, B) = 1$ is $\frac{5}{11}$, $d(A, B) = 2$ is $\frac{5}{11}$, and $d(A, B) = 3$ is $\frac{1}{11}$.
Question 1.4: How do we calculate the probability of $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$?  
Answer 1.4: We consider two cases. First case: $d(Q, R) = 2$ and $d(R, S) = 1$ (probability $\frac{5}{11} \times \frac{5}{11} = \frac{25}{121}$). Second case: $d(Q, R) = 3$ and $d(R, S) = 1$ or $d(R, S) = 2$ (probability $\frac{1}{11} \times \frac{10}{11} = \frac{10}{121}$).  
Adding these, the total probability is $\frac{25}{121} + \frac{10}{121} = \frac{35}{121} = \frac{7}{22}$.
Question 1.5: Now we can answer the question: What is the probability that $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$?  
Answer 1.5: The probability is $\frac{7}{22}$. The answer is A.

Question 2: A rhombic dodecahedron is a solid with $12$ congruent rhombus faces. At every vertex, $3$ or $4$ edges meet, depending on the vertex. How many vertices have exactly $3$ edges meet?\n\n$\\textbf{(A) }5\\qquad\\textbf{(B) }6\\qquad\\textbf{(C) }7\\qquad\\textbf{(D) }8\\qquad\\textbf{(E) }9$
Question 2.1: How many vertices does a rhombic dodecahedron have?  
Answer 2.1: A rhombic dodecahedron has $14$ vertices.
Question 2.2: How many edges and faces does a rhombic dodecahedron have?  
Answer 2.2: A rhombic dodecahedron has $24$ edges and $12$ rhombus faces.
Question 2.3: How are the vertices classified by the number of edges meeting?  
Answer 2.3: Some vertices have $3$ edges meeting, and others have $4$ edges meeting.
Question 2.4: How many vertices have $4$ edges meeting?  
Answer 2.4: A rhombic dodecahedron has $6$ vertices where $4$ edges meet.
Question 2.5: How many vertices have $3$ edges meeting?  
Answer 2.5: The remaining $14 - 6 = 8$ vertices have $3$ edges meeting.
Question 2.6: Now we can answer the question: How many vertices have exactly $3$ edges meet?  
Answer 2.6: The number of vertices with exactly $3$ edges meeting is $8$. The answer is D.

Question 3: The line segment formed by $A(1, 2)$ and $B(3, 3)$ is rotated to the line segment formed by $A'(3, 1)$ and $B'(4, 3)$ about the point $P(r, s)$. What is $|r-s|$?\n\n$\\textbf{(A) } \\frac{1}{4} \\qquad \\textbf{(B) } \\frac{1}{2} \\qquad \\textbf{(C) } \\frac{3}{4} \\qquad \\textbf{(D) } \\frac{2}{3} \\qquad \\textbf{(E) } 1$
Question 3.1: What is the midpoint of the line segment $AB$?  
Answer 3.1: The midpoint of $A(1, 2)$ and $B(3, 3)$ is $\left(\frac{1+3}{2}, \frac{2+3}{2}\right) = (2, 2.5)$.  
Question 3.2: What is the midpoint of the line segment $A'B'$?  
Answer 3.2: The midpoint of $A'(3, 1)$ and $B'(4, 3)$ is $\left(\frac{3+4}{2}, \frac{1+3}{2}\right) = (3.5, 2)$.  
Question 3.3: What is the center of rotation $P(r, s)$?  
Answer 3.3: The center of rotation is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of $AB$ and $A'B'$. Solving the perpendicular bisectors, we find $P(r, s) = (2.5, 2.5)$.  
Question 3.4: What are the coordinates of $P(r, s)$?  
Answer 3.4: The coordinates of $P(r, s)$ are $r = 2.5$ and $s = 2.5$.
Question 3.5: Now we can answer the question: What is $|r-s|$ if $P = (2.5, 2.5)$?
Answer 3.5: Given $P(r, s) = (2.5, 2.5)$, we have $|r - s| = |2.5 - 2.5| = 0$. The answer is E.
