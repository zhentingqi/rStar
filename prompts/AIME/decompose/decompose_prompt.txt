Question 1: In a sequence, the first term is 2 and each successive term is 3 times the previous term. What is the sum of the first 6 terms of this geometric sequence?
Question 1.1: What is the formula for the sum of the first $n$ terms of a geometric sequence with the first term $a$ and common ratio $r$?
Answer 1.1: The sum of the first $n$ terms of a geometric sequence is given by $S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}$, where $a$ is the first term, $r$ is the common ratio, and $n$ is the number of terms. The answer is $S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}$.
Question 1.2: What are the values of $a$, $r$, and $n$ in this problem?
Answer 1.2: In this sequence, $a = 2$, $r = 3$, and $n = 6$. The answer is $a = 2$, $r = 3$, and $n = 6$.
Question 1.3: What is the sum of the first 6 terms using the formula $S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}$?
Answer 1.3: Substituting $a = 2$, $r = 3$, and $n = 6$ into the formula, we get $S_6 = 2 \frac{1 - 3^6}{1 - 3} = 2 \frac{1 - 729}{-2} = 2 \times 364.5 = 729$. The answer is 729.
Question 1.4: Now we can answer the question: What is the sum of the first 6 terms of this geometric sequence?
Answer 1.4: The sum of the first 6 terms is 729. The answer is 729.

Question 2: Find the remainder when 123456 is divided by 9.  
Question 2.1: What is the rule for finding the remainder of a number when divided by 9?  
Answer 2.1: The remainder when a number is divided by 9 is equal to the remainder when the sum of its digits is divided by 9. The answer is that we sum the digits and then find the remainder when that sum is divided by 9.  
Question 2.2: What is the sum of the digits of 123456?  
Answer 2.2: The sum of the digits of 123456 is $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21$. The answer is 21.  
Question 2.3: What is the remainder when 21 is divided by 9?  
Answer 2.3: The remainder when 21 is divided by 9 is 3. The answer is 3.  
Question 2.4: Now we can answer the question: What is the remainder when 123456 is divided by 9?  
Answer 2.4: The remainder when 123456 is divided by 9 is 3. The answer is 3.  

Question 3: If the sum of two numbers is 20 and their product is 96, what is the sum of their squares?  
Question 3.1: What is the formula for the sum of the squares of two numbers $a$ and $b$ in terms of their sum and product?  
Answer 3.1: The sum of the squares of two numbers $a$ and $b$ is given by $a^2 + b^2 = (a + b)^2 - 2ab$. The answer is $a^2 + b^2 = (a + b)^2 - 2ab$.  
Question 3.2: What are the values of $a + b$ and $ab$ given in this problem?  
Answer 3.2: We are given $a + b = 20$ and $ab = 96$. The answer is $a + b = 20$ and $ab = 96$.  
Question 3.3: Substitute $a + b = 20$ and $ab = 96$ into the formula for the sum of the squares.  
Answer 3.3: Substituting the values, we get $a^2 + b^2 = (20)^2 - 2 \times 96 = 400 - 192 = 208$. The answer is 208.  
Question 3.4: Now we can answer the question: What is the sum of their squares?  
Answer 3.4: The sum of the squares of the two numbers is 208. The answer is 208.

Question 4: A rectangle has a perimeter of 50 units. If the length of the rectangle is 3 times its width, what is the area of the rectangle?  
Question 4.1: What is the relationship between the length and the width of the rectangle?  
Answer 4.1: The length $L$ is 3 times the width $W$, so $L = 3W$. The answer is $L = 3W$.  
Question 4.2: What is the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle in terms of its length and width?  
Answer 4.2: The perimeter $P$ of a rectangle is given by $P = 2L + 2W$. The answer is $P = 2L + 2W$.  
Question 4.3: Substitute $L = 3W$ into the perimeter formula and solve for $W$ when $P = 50$.  
Answer 4.3: Substituting $L = 3W$ into the formula, we get $50 = 2(3W) + 2W = 6W + 2W = 8W$. Dividing both sides by 8, we find $W = 6.25$. The answer is $W = 6.25$.  
Question 4.4: What is the length of the rectangle?  
Answer 4.4: Since $L = 3W$, the length $L = 3 \times 6.25 = 18.75$. The answer is $L = 18.75$.  
Question 4.5: Now we can answer the question: What is the area of the rectangle?  
Answer 4.5: The area $A$ of the rectangle is $L \times W = 18.75 \times 6.25 = 117.1875$. The answer is 117.1875.
