### Instruction:
In a sequence, the first term is 2 and each successive term is 3 times the previous term. What is the sum of the first 6 terms of this geometric sequence?

### Response:
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Identify the sequence. The sequence is geometric with the first term $a = 2$ and common ratio $r = 3$.
Step 2: Use the sum formula for the first $n$ terms of a geometric sequence: $S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}$.
Step 3: Substitute the known values: $a = 2$, $r = 3$, and $n = 6$: $S_6 = 2 \frac{1 - 3^6}{1 - 3}$.
Step 4: Simplify the expression: $S_6 = 2 \frac{1 - 729}{-2} = 2 \frac{-728}{-2} = 2 \times 364 = 728$.
Step 5: The answer is 728.

### Instruction:
Find the remainder when 123456 is divided by 9.

### Response:
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: To find the remainder when a number is divided by 9, sum the digits of the number. If the sum is greater than 9, repeat the process until a single-digit number is obtained.
Step 2: Sum the digits of 123456: $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21$.
Step 3: Since 21 is still greater than 9, sum the digits of 21: $2 + 1 = 3$.
Step 4: The remainder when 123456 is divided by 9 is 3.
Step 5: The answer is 3.

### Instruction:
A rectangle has a perimeter of 50 units. If the length of the rectangle is 3 times its width, what is the area of the rectangle?

### Response:
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Let the width of the rectangle be $w$. Then, the length is $3w$.
Step 2: The perimeter of the rectangle is given by: $2(\text{length} + \text{width}) = 50$.
Step 3: Substitute the expressions for length and width: $2(3w + w) = 50$.
Step 4: Simplify and solve for $w$: $2(4w) = 50$, $8w = 50$, $w = \frac{50}{8} = 6.25$.
Step 5: Find the length: $\text{Length} = 3w = 3 \times 6.25 = 18.75$.
Step 6: Find the area of the rectangle: $\text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 18.75 \times 6.25 = 117.1875$.
Step 7: The answer is 117.1875.

### Instruction:
Solve for $x$ in the equation $5x + 3 = 4x - 7$.

### Response:
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Subtract $4x$ from both sides of the equation: $5x + 3 - 4x = -7$.
Step 2: Simplify the equation: $x + 3 = -7$.
Step 3: Subtract 3 from both sides: $x = -10$.
Step 4: The answer is -10.

### Instruction:
If the sum of two numbers is 20 and their product is 96, what is the sum of their squares?

### Response:
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Let the two numbers be $a$ and $b$. Given: $a + b = 20$ and $ab = 96$.
Step 2: Use the identity for the sum of squares: $a^2 + b^2 = (a + b)^2 - 2ab$.
Step 3: Substitute the known values: $a^2 + b^2 = 20^2 - 2 \times 96$.
Step 4: Simplify the expression: $a^2 + b^2 = 400 - 192 = 208$.
Step 5: The answer is 208.
