### Instruction:
In a sequence, the first term is 2 and each successive term is 3 times the previous term. What is the sum of the first 6 terms of this geometric sequence?

### Response:
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: The first term of the sequence is $a_1 = 2$ and the common ratio is $r = 3$.
Step 2: The general formula for the $n$-th term of a geometric sequence is $a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{n-1}$.
Step 3: Using this formula, the first six terms are: $a_1 = 2$. $a_2 = 2 \cdot 3 = 6$. $a_3 = 6 \cdot 3 = 18$. $a_4 = 18 \cdot 3 = 54$. $a_5 = 54 \cdot 3 = 162$. $a_6 = 162 \cdot 3 = 486$.
Step 4: The formula for the sum of the first $n$ terms of a geometric sequence is $S_n = a_1 \cdot \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}$.
Step 5: Substitute $a_1 = 2$, $r = 3$, and $n = 6$ into the sum formula: $S_6 = 2 \cdot \frac{1 - 3^6}{1 - 3}$.
Step 6: Simplifying the expression: $S_6 = 2 \cdot \frac{1 - 729}{-2}$. $S_6 = 2 \cdot \frac{-728}{-2}$. $S_6 = 2 \cdot 364 = 728$.
Step 7: The sum of the first 6 terms of this geometric sequence is 728.
Step 8: The answer is 728.

### Instruction:
Find the remainder when 123456 is divided by 9.
x
### Response:
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: According to the divisibility rule of 9, a number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.
Step 2: The digits of 123456 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
Step 3: The sum of these digits is $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21$.
Step 4: Now, we find the remainder when 21 is divided by 9: $21 \div 9 = 2$ remainder $3$.
Step 5: Therefore, the remainder when 123456 is divided by 9 is 3.
Step 6: The answer is 3.

### Instruction:
A rectangle has a perimeter of 50 units. If the length of the rectangle is  3 times its width, what is the area of the rectangle?

### Response:
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Let the width of the rectangle be $w$. The length of the rectangle is given as $3$ times the width, so the length is $3w$.
Step 2: The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is $P = 2 \cdot (l + w)$.
Step 3: Substituting the given values into the formula: $50 = 2 \cdot (3w + w)$.
Step 4: Simplifying the equation: $50 = 2 \cdot 4w$. $50 = 8w$.
Step 5: Solving for $w$: $w = \frac{50}{8} = 6.25$.
Step 6: Now, find the length: $l = 3w = 3 \cdot 6.25 = 18.75$.
Step 7: The area of a rectangle is given by: $A = l \cdot w$.
Step 8: Substituting the values of $l$ and $w$: $A = 18.75 \cdot 6.25 = 117.1875$.
Step 9: Therefore, the area of the rectangle is $117.1875$ square units.
Step 10: The answer is 10
