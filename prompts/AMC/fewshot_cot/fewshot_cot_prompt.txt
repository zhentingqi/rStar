### Instruction:
In a sequence, the first term is 2 and each successive term is 3 times the previous term. What is the sum of the first 6 terms of this geometric sequence?

### Response:
Let's think step by step. This is a geometric sequence where the first term $a = 2$ and the common ratio $r = 3$. The sum of the first $n$ terms of a geometric sequence is given by $S_n = a \frac{1-r^n}{1-r}$. For the first 6 terms, $a = 2$, $r = 3$, and $n = 6$: $S_6 = 2 \frac{1 - 3^6}{1 - 3} = 2 \frac{1 - 729}{-2} = 2 \times \frac{-728}{-2} = 2 \times 364 = 728$. The answer is: 728.

### Instruction:
Find the remainder when 123456 is divided by 9.

### Response:
Let's think step by step. To find the remainder when a number is divided by 9, we can sum its digits and then find the remainder of that sum when divided by 9. The digits of 123456 are: $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21$. Now, sum the digits of 21: $2 + 1 = 3$. The remainder when 123456 is divided by 9 is the same as the remainder when 3 is divided by 9, which is 3. The answer is: 3.

### Instruction:
If the sum of two numbers is 20 and their product is 96, what is the sum of their squares?

### Response:
Let's think step by step. Let the two numbers be $a$ and $b$. Given: $a + b = 20$ and $ab = 96$. We need to find $a^2 + b^2$. We use the identity: $a^2 + b^2 = (a + b)^2 - 2ab$. Plugging in the given values: $a^2 + b^2 = 20^2 - 2 \times 96 = 400 - 192 = 208$. The answer is: 208.

### Instruction:
A rectangle has a perimeter of 50 units. If the length of the rectangle is 3 times its width, what is the area of the rectangle?

### Response:
Let's think step by step. Let the width of the rectangle be $w$ units. Since the length is 3 times the width, the length is $3w$ units. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by $P = 2(\text{length} + \text{width})$. Plugging in the values: $50 = 2(3w + w) = 2 \times 4w = 8w$. Divide both sides by 8 to find the width: $w = \frac{50}{8} = 6.25$ units. Now, the length is $3w = 3 \times 6.25 = 18.75$ units. The area of the rectangle is $\text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 18.75 \times 6.25 = 117.1875$ square units. The answer is: 117.1875.
