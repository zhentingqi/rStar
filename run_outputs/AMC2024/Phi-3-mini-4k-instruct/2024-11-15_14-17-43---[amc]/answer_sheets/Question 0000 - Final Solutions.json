Simplifying the expressions individually first:\n\nFor $9901\\cdot101$: Multiplying out both digits you get $(99\\cdot101)\\cdot100 + 99\\cdot101$ because when multiplying powers of ten add them. This simplifies to $99\\cdot(101\\cdot100+101) = 99\\cdot(101\\cdot101)$. So now our equation looks like this: $99\\cdot(101^2)$. And for $-99\\cdot10101$, multiply straight forward giving us simply $-99\\cdot101^2$. Now substituting back into original formula becomes $99\\cdot101^2 - (-99\\cdot101^2) = 2\\cdot99\\cdot101^2$. When simplified further considering properties of exponents becoming straightforward single term yields result matching most nearly closest integer; therefore correct selection corresponds Option '**(B) **~20'.",
