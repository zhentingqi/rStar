Given a positive integer $n$, if $n$ is a multiple of $3$, then you replace $n$ by \\( \\frac{n}{3} \\). If $n$ is not a multiple of $3$, then you replace $n$ by $n+10$. Then continue this process. For example, beginning with $n=4$, this procedure gives $4 \\to 14 \\to 24 \\to 8 \\to 18 \\to 6 \\to 2 \\to 12 \\to \\cdots$. Suppose you start with $n=100$.

As indicated in the hints provided, there are two cases to consider: when $n$ is a multiple of $3$ and when it isn\u2019t.

To approach this problem systematically, let's understand what happens after performing the replacement operation 100 times starting with $n=100$. Notice that when we apply the replacement rule twice, we always get back to $100$. This leads us to consider how we can break down the problem into manageable parts using the properties of modular arithmetic, especially considering residues modulo 3. We want to analyze what happens to the value of $n$ after repeated applications of the transformation. It\u2019s helpful to work out examples for several iterations of the operation and keep track of patterns in the numbers involved. After carrying out some calculations, we notice that when $n$ is replaced by $\\frac{n}{3}$, the result leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 3. When we instead replace $n$ by $n + 10$, we find that we\u2019re left with a remainder of 1 when dividing by 3. Therefore, regardless of whether we replace $n$ by $\\frac{n}{3}$ or $n+10$, the new value will leave a remainder of 1 upon division by 3. Hence, repeating the process doesn\u2019t change the fact that $n$ is a remainder of 1 when divided by 3; since it never changes, 100 is still the number we started with, thus leading us to our answer. However, looking closely at the details of the transformation reveals that, indeed, after applying both replacement rules repeatedly, $n$ remains unchanged. Given that we need to perform this transformation 100 times, the conclusion is drawn based on recognizing the invariant behavior of the transformation.
