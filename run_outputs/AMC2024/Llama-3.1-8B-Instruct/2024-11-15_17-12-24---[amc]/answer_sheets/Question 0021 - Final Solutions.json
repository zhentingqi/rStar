However, these include cases where not all rolls are different. We must remove such cases, i.e., when 2 or more of the rolls are the same number. There are two ways this can happen: either there's a pair among the four values, or there's no pair among them, so all the values appear twice. For a given set of 4 values, there are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose a pair. Now consider our given set of 4 values, say {A,B,C,D}. We know there are 24 total permutations of the four letters, since they are all distinct. But we also know that only 12 of those have the property that some value appears twice, so there are $6 \\cdot 12 = 72$ ways to create a roll that has some repeated numbers. This leaves us with $720 - 72 = 648$. However, there is another possibility to account for. The case in which all the numbers are different is still included in the 648. Since it should not be, we need to add 24 back into the count. This gives us a final count of 672. Thus, in 672/1296 cases, the bee visits all 8 vertices of the cube. Hence, the probability that the bee visits all eight vertices of the cube is $$\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } \\dfrac{7}{54}}.$$\nTherefore, the answer is B.\nThe answer is: B.", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 8}]
