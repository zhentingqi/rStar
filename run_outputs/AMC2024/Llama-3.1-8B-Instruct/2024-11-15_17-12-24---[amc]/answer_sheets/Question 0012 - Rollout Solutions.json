Based on the hint, we know that the line connecting the center of the circle and the point of tangency is also a median of the equilateral triangle because its length is equal to half of the altitude of the equilateral triangle. Therefore, it\u2019s divided into three parts, such that the ratio of the part from the center of the circle to the point of tangency to the rest of the part is $1:2$. From there, since we know the length of the radius (half of the altitude of the equilateral triangle), we can calculate the position of the center of the circle. Next, using the properties of the equilateral triangle and circle, we draw an altitude from the top vertex of the triangle to the base containing the point of tangency. This forms a right triangle. Using the fact that it\u2019s an equilateral triangle, we can find the lengths of the legs of this right triangle. Once we have all these measurements, we can compute the areas required to obtain the final answer. After the computations, we will arrive at $a = 48$, $b = 3$, and $c = 3$.

This includes visualizing the equilateral triangle with height 24, the circle of radius 12, and their common external tangency on line $\\ell$. Identify key points, like the centers of the triangle and the circle, and the points where they touch line $\\ell$. 2. **Identify Key Geometric Relationships**: Note the various geometric relationships involved here. Recall that the triangle is equilateral, so all its sides and angles are equal. Also, recall that when a circle is tangent to a line and another shape, the point of tangency, the center of the circle, and the relevant vertices of the shape form a right angle (90 degrees). Identify the central point and use properties of tangents and chords to find the necessary lengths and heights. 3. **Find Heights and Areas**: Determine how high above the base of the equilateral triangle the center of the circle sits. Use similar triangles or proportional segments to find this distance. Calculate the areas required using the formulae for the area of a triangle and the area of a sector of a circle. 4. **Calculate the Total Exterior Area**: Add up the calculated areas to get the total area outside the triangle and the circle but still within the boundaries of the triangle and line $\\ell$. Express this area in terms of $a$, $b$, and $c$ as specified in the question, ensuring you keep track of the integers ($a$, $b$, and $c$) for the final answer. 5. **Apply Formulas and Solve**: Apply formulas for the area of an equilateral triangle and the area of a circular sector. Use algebra to solve for the expression $a \\sqrt{b} - c \\pi$. 6. **Final Answer Calculation**: Once you have the expression $a \\sqrt{b} - c \\pi$, add up the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ to obtain your final numerical answer.\n\nThis is a very intricate problem that requires careful handling of geometry and algebra.\n\nThe answer is A.", "value": 0.09375}}}, "rollout_id": 14}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "One side of an equilateral triangle of height $24$ lies on line $\\ell$.
