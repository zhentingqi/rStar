To solve this problem, let\u2019s consider each pair of transformations and see if they commute. Translations and dilations do not commute, nor do reflections and dilations. However, translations and reflections commute since reflecting a translated object is equivalent to translating its reflection. Rotations and reflections also commute, because the image of rotating a reflected object is the same as the reflection of a rotated object. So far, we've accounted for all combinations except the dilation-transformation pair. Dilations commute among themselves, so they commute with every other type of transformation. Therefore, out of the six possible pairs of transformations, three commute: Translation-reflection, Rotation-reflection, and Translation-dilation, Rotation-dilation, Reflection-dilation.
