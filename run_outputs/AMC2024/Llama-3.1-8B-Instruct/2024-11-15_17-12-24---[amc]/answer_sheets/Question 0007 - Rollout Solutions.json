For the first $60$ minutes after $1:00$ PM, the group packs $96$ packages per minute. Thus, from $1:00$ PM until Daria joins, the three members (Amy, Bomani, and Charlie) have already packed $(60-t)\\cdot10=600-10t$ packages. After Daria joins, she packs $5$ packages every $4$ minutes, which translates to $5/4$ packages per minute. Therefore, let us calculate the number of minutes required for the four members to pack $450-600+10t$ packages. This can be represented using the equation $\\frac {5}{4}(90+t)=450-600+10t.$ From here, we have $225+5t=400+40t$. Subtracting $5t$ from both sides yields $225=400+35t$. Next, subtracting 400 from both sides yields $-175=35t$, giving $t=-5$. However, since time cannot be negative, we continue our search.
