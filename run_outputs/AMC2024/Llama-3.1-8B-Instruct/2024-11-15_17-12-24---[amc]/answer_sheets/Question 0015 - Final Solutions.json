The hint emphasizes that we can consider other bases than just the decimal system when dealing with representations. When expressing $2024_b$ in base $b$, the value is equivalent to $2b^3+0b^2+2b+4$. To check for divisibility by 16, we evaluate this expression modulo 16. Given that we're working in base $b$, let\u2019s examine how values of $b$ affect the overall expression modulo 16, and apply divisibility principles accordingly:  First, notice that $2024_b$ simplifies to $2b^3+4$, since all terms involving lower powers of $b$ vanish in the base-$b$ representation. Now, because $4\\equiv 4\\bmod{16}$ and our goal is to ensure divisibility by 16, we must guarantee $2b^3\\equiv -4\\bmod {16}$ so that their sum yields a multiple of 16. By checking the range specified ($5 \\leq b \\leq 2024$), it turns out that there are nine possibilities to satisfy this condition. Therefore, the number of possible values for $b$ is nine, making the sum of its digits $9$.

From Condition 2, we know that 2024 in base $b$ ends in two zeros, so we can express 2024 in base $b$ as $AB00_b$ for some digits $A,B \\in [0,b-1]$. According to Condition 2, the expression $AB00_b$ should be divisible by $16$. Therefore, the expression can be expanded into $A*b^3 + B*b^2 + 0*b + 0$. Then we get a conclusion that the coefficient of $b^3$ and the coefficient of $b$ should be even numbers. After checking, the numbers less than 10 can only satisfy this condition: $b=6,10,$ and $b=18$ cannot be satisfied since the digits should be smaller than $b$.
