Our goal is to minimize $b$ while ensuring it remains an integer and greater than 720, thus maximizing $a$. We will analyze the options to identify the smallest suitable value for $a$. It turns out that when $a = 10$, then $b = \\frac{720^2}{10} = 518400$, making this our optimal choice for minimizing $b$.
