Condition 1:  There is only one way for all four rolls to result in an equal number (e.g., four A+'s), as this will occur on average once every $$3^4=81$$ trials. Condition 2: In order for all four rolls to be different numbers, we need to pick which 4 out of 6 possible options each roll can take. Therefore, there are 720 possibilities, but these include cases where not all rolls are different. We must remove such cases, i.e. when 2 or more of the rolls are the same number. There are two ways this can happen: either there's a pair among the four values, or there's no pair among them, so all the values appear twice. For a given set of 4 values, there are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose a pair. Now consider our given set of 4 values, say {A,B,C,D}. We know there are 24 total permutations of the four letters, since they are all distinct. But we also know that only 12 of those have the property that some value appears twice, so there are $6 \\cdot 12 =72$ ways to create a roll that has some repeated numbers. This leaves us with $720 - 72 =648$. However, there is another possibility to account for. The case in which all the numbers are different is still included in the 648. Since it should not be, we need to add 24 back into the count. This gives us a final count of 672. Thus, in 672/1296 cases, the bee visits all 8 vertices of the cube.

The bee starts at the origin and rolls a die, moving according to the roll result each time. This process is repeated four times. To reach a point along a single axis, all movements must be towards that axis. Analyzing the movements based on die outcomes: 1. When rolling $A^+$, the bee moves right; when rolling $A^-$, the bee moves left. For reaching points strictly left of the origin, such as $(-2,-2,-2)$, consider that after the first roll, the position becomes either $(-1,-2,-2)$ if $A^-$ was rolled or remains at the origin if $A^+$ is rolled. Further rolls will make no difference since a negative move will cancel out a positive move from a previous roll due to them being opposite. Hence, points only reachable from the origin along the x-axis are those that can be reached starting from $x=0$. 2. Similar analysis applies to the y and z axes. However, our interest lies in finding which combinations allow us to remain confined within a single axis, indicating movement away from the origin does not occur across axes.
