To approach this problem systematically, let's understand what happens after performing the replacement operation 100 times starting with $n=100$. Notice that when we apply the replacement rule twice, we always get back to $100$. This leads us to consider how we can break down the problem into manageable parts using the properties of modular arithmetic, especially considering residues modulo 3. We want to analyze what happens to the value of $n$ after repeated applications of the transformation. It\u2019s helpful to work out examples for several iterations of the operation and keep track of patterns in the numbers involved. After carrying out some calculations, we notice that when $n$ is replaced by $\\frac{n}{3}$, the result leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 3. When we instead replace $n$ by $n + 10$, we find that we\u2019re left with a remainder of 1 when dividing by 3. Therefore, regardless of whether we replace $n$ by $\\frac{n}{3}$ or $n+10$, the new value will leave a remainder of 1 upon division by 3. Hence, repeating the process doesn\u2019t change the fact that $n$ is a remainder of 1 when divided by 3; since it never changes, 100 is still the number we started with, thus leading us to our answer. However, looking closely at the details of the transformation reveals that, indeed, after applying both replacement rules repeatedly, $n$ remains unchanged.

This involves finding how many numbers less than or equal to 100 are divisible by 3, as we will use this count as a threshold to know when we can apply the division rule instead of the addition rule. Counting from 100 down to the nearest multiple of 3 gives us 33 multiples of 3 below or at 100. Therefore, we need 100 - 33 = 67 applications of the division rule after reaching a multiple of 3.
