If the hundreds digit is 0, then the tens and ones digits must add up to 11. This gives us only one solution, namely 110. If the hundreds digit is 1, then the tens and ones digits must add up to 0. This also yields only one solution, namely 110, which we counted above. If the hundreds digit is 2, then the tens and ones digits must add up to -11, but there are no solutions here because the tens and ones digits must be non-negative. If the hundreds digit is 3, then the tens and ones digits must add up to -1. Again, there are no solutions here. Finally, if the hundreds digit is at least four, then the tens and ones digits cannot add up to a negative integer, so there are no solutions in these cases either. Thus, there is a total of $\\boxed{1}$ solution when the hundreds digit is zero, and there is a total of $\\boxed{1}$ solution when the hundreds digit is one.

For each team, we must select 2 juniors out of 6. This is given by the combination formula ${6 \\choose 2}$. However, we're choosing 3 groups of 2 juniors and 2 seniors each. This implies we're essentially creating 3 pairs, which doesn't directly apply because we're dealing with multiple groups rather than just pairing within them."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. First, choose two juniors from six. Second, choose two seniors from three. Third, arrange the three groups in some order. Fourth, arrange the people within the first group in some order.

Given that we need 3 disjoint teams, each having 2 juniors and 2 seniors, let\u2019s analyze this problem further. With 6 juniors available, we can assign them to the teams without violating condition 2.
