From the hint above, Team A can win the playoff in the following ways: $(W, W), (W, L, W),$ and $(L, W, W)$ where $W$ denotes a win and $L$ a loss. First consider the case $(W, W)$. This means that Team A won the first game and the second game at home, both of which occur with probability $\\frac{2}{3}$. Note that since the outcome of the first game is known, this scenario is independent of the third game. Thus the probability of this occurring is $\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2$. Next consider the case $(W, L, W)$. In this case, the probability of winning the first game is still $\\frac{2}{3}$, and the probability of losing the second game is $1-\\frac{1}{3}= \\frac{2}{3}$. Now we must find the probability that the team wins the third game. Since they lost the second game, the third game was played away from home and thus has probability $p$. This makes the probability of the case $(W, L, W)$ equal to $\\frac{2}{3}p$. Finally, consider the case $(L, W, W)$. Here we know that Team A won the last two games, but lost the middle one, which occurred with probability $1-\\frac{2}{3}=\\frac{1}{3}$. The probability of winning the second game was just $p$, and the probability of winning the third game is also $p$. Combining everything, the probability of this case is $\\frac{1}{3}p^2$.

Given the setup, the possible scenarios for a best-of-three series can be enumerated: - Win-Win-Lose: This means Team A wins all three games, in order. There is only one way to achieve this: The first and second games are won, and the third game is lost. Therefore, the probability of this case occurring is $(a)(a)(1-b)=(\\frac{2}{3})(\\frac{2}{3})(1-b)=\\frac{4}{9}-\\frac{4}{9}b$. - Win-Lose-Win: Team A loses the first game, but wins the other two. Again, the probability of this occurrence is $[(1-a)b](1-b)[a]=(\\frac{1}{3})(b)\\cdot(1-b)\\cdot(\\frac{2}{3})=\\frac{1}{9}-(1/9)b^2$. - Lose-Win-Win: This case occurs when Team A loses the first game, and wins both the second and third games. Its probability is also $(1-a)b(a)=(\\frac{1}{3})(b)\\cdot(\\frac{2}{3})=\\frac{2}{9}b$. These cases can be combined into a single expression representing the total probability of Team A winning the playoff, which is calculated as follows: $\\begin{aligned} P & = \\left( \\frac{4}{9}-\\frac{4}{9}b \\right)+\\left( \\frac{2}{9}b-\\frac{2}{27}b^{2} \\right)+\\left( \\frac{2}{9}b \\right) \\\\ & = \\frac{4}{9}-\\frac{4}{9}b+\\frac{2}{9}b-\\frac{2}{27}b^{2}+\\frac{2}{9}b \\\\ & = \\frac{12-4b+6b-2b^{2}+6b}{27} \\\\ & = \\frac{-2b^{2}+16b+12}{27} \\end{aligned}$ The question indicates that the overall probability of A winning the playoff is $\\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, $\\frac{-2b^2+16b+12}{27}=\\frac{1}{2}$. Solving the quadratic equation yields $b = \\frac{19}{23}$; therefore, $m=19$ and $n=299$, and $m+n=\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }318}$.
