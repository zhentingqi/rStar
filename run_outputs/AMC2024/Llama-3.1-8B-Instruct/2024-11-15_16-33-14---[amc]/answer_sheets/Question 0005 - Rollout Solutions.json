We start by placing the first letter \"A\" at the end of the string, followed by moving the next available letter \"B\" to the new starting position.", "2": "Swapping \"B\" into its correct position would require only one swap since we're aiming to place it directly after the previous swap. Subsequent swaps will continue to place adjacent letters in their correct positions.", "3": "The number of swaps required to achieve this arrangement, however, can't simply be determined by counting the positions of \"B\" or other letters, but rather through understanding how our desired permutation works, considering each letter's placement individually.", "4": "Given the specific arrangement sought ($FEDCBA$), one must recognize that the desired configuration involves rotating the original arrangement clockwise.", "5": "Our goal is to transform $ABCDEF$ into $FEDCBA$. One approach to accomplish this efficiently is by swapping two pairs of elements at once, taking advantage of symmetry to reduce the overall number of steps."}}}, "rollout_id": 0}]
