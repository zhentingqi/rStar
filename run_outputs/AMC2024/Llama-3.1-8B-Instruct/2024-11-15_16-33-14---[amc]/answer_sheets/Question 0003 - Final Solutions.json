Let $x$ be the number of two-digit numbers used to express $2024$. Then $10x \\le 2024 < 100 x,$ so $202 < 10x < 200.$ Therefore, $20.2 < x < 20.$ Since $x$ is an integer, this means that $x=20$ or $x=21$. If $x=20,$ then the numbers are $10, 11, \\ldots, 99$.

The solution begins with finding the largest possible two-digit number that could fit into our target value 2024. This turns out to be 99. However, since we need to minimize the total count of two-digit numbers required, we'll instead consider writing down the greatest multiple of 99 that doesn't exceed 2024. We get 99 * 20 = 1980. So now, the remaining value would be 2024 - 1980 = 44. Now we are left with needing to express the value 44 using two-digit numbers. It can be expressed using just one two-digit number - 44 itself. Therefore, combining both parts together, we need at least 21 two-digit numbers to represent the original number 2024. The answer is B.", "value": 0.375}}}, "rollout_id": 0}]
