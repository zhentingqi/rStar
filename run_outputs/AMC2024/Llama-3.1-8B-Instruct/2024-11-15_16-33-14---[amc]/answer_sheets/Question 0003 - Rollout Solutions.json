The solution begins with finding the largest possible two-digit number that could fit into our target value 2024. This turns out to be 99. However, since we need to minimize the total count of two-digit numbers required, we'll instead consider writing down the greatest multiple of 99 that doesn't exceed 2024. We get 99 * 20 = 1980. So now, the remaining value would be 2024 - 1980 = 44. Now we are left with needing to express the value 44 using two-digit numbers. It can be expressed using just one two-digit number - 44 itself. Therefore, combining both parts together, we need at least 21 two-digit numbers to represent the original number 2024. The answer is B.", "value": 0.375}}}, "rollout_id": 0}]
