The model estimates that it will take $69$ minutes to hike to the top if a trail is $1.5$ miles long and ascends $800$ feet, as well as if a trail is $1.2$ miles long and ascends $1100$ feet.

Having found $a$ and $b$, the model's prediction for time $T$ in minutes is $T = 17 L - \\frac{55}{8} G.$ Using this formula, we compute the predicted hiking time for a $4.2$ mile long trail with an elevation gain of $4000$ feet as follows: $T = 17(4.2) - \\frac{55}{8}(4000) = 71.4 - 27500 = 258$. Therefore, our final answer is $258$, so the answer is D.",
