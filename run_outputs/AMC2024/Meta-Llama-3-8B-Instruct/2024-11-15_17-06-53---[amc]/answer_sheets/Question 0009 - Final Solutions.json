If $N$ is a multiple of $3$ ($N=k\\cdot3$), apply condition 1 to get $\\frac{k\\cdot3}{3}=k.$ On the other hand, if $N$ is not a multiple of $3$ ($N=m$), apply condition 2 to get $N+m=10+m.$ Therefore, we conclude that the possible values of $N$ after applying these transformations are $0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 9,$ which are all integers. The answer is 1. Final Answer: The answer is E.

Suppose we're told that N=15, which is a multiple of 3. According to condition 1, N would be replaced by \\frac{N}{3}=5. On the other hand, if N was not a multiple of 3, say N=17, according to condition 2, N would be replaced by N+10=27. If N=18, which is also a multiple of 3, again using condition 1, N would be replaced by \\frac{N}{3}=6. And if N=19, which is not a multiple of 3, using condition 2, N would be replaced by N+10=29. From this analysis, it seems clear that no matter what N is, we always get a result ending in 0 or 5 after applying either condition 1 or condition 2. Therefore, the answer is E.
