First, draw a diagram of the situation according to the hint. Observe that the equilateral triangle is divided into three parts: a right triangle and two isosceles right triangles. Next, calculate the areas of these shapes. The base and height of the equilateral triangle are both 24, so its area is $24^2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} = 144\\sqrt{3}$. The right triangle has legs 12 and $\\sqrt{576} = 24$, so its area is $(12)(24)/2 = 144$. Each of the two isosceles right triangles has legs 12 and 12, so they both have area $(12)^2/2 = 72$. Therefore, the total area of the part outside the circle and triangle is $144\\sqrt{3} - 144 - 2(72) = 144\\sqrt{3} - 144 - 144 = 144(\\sqrt{3}-2)$. Thus, $a=144$, $b=3$, and $c=2$, so $a+b+c=\\boxed{149}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 149.
