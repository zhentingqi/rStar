So far, they have packed $t/3 \\cdot 10$ packages. When Daria joins, she packs $5$ packages every $4$ minutes, so the total rate increases to $(t/3)\\cdot 10+5/(t/4)$. They finish packing $450$ packages by $2:45 PM$, when $t=90$. Plugging in $t=90$ into the equation above, we get $(90/3)(10)+5/(90/4)=100+5/3=105$ packages per minute. Therefore, the time elapsed before Daria joined is $60$ minutes ($1:00$ PM), and Daria joined at $1:00$ PM + $15$ minutes, which is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}~1:45 \\text{ PM}}$. \nFinal Answer: The answer is C.
