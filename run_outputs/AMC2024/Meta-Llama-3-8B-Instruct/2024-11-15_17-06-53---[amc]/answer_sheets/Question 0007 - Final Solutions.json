From the condition provided, we know that it takes each person 3 minutes to send one package. Therefore, we must consider sending packages sequentially. If Amy sends her first package, she will take 3 minutes. During those 3 minutes, Bomani cannot start sending his package because he also needs 3 minutes. Similarly, Charlie cannot start sending his package during those 3 minutes either. Thus, after 3 minutes, only Amy can send another package. This process continues until all packages have been sent. After calculating the total time required, we can see that all 3 people can finish their tasks in 9 minutes, starting from 0 minutes. The answer is 9.", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 13}]
