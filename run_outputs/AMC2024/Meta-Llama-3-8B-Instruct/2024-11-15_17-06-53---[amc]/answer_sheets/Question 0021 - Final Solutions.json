If the die shows $1$, the bee moves left; if it shows $2$, the bee moves right; if it shows $3$, the bee moves up; and if it shows $4$, the bee moves down. We are interested in finding the probability that the bee is back at its starting position after rolling the die once. Since all faces of the die have equal probability of being rolled, we calculate the probability of returning to the origin using the total number of valid movements:\n\nThere are $4$ valid movements.\nOnly one movement returns the bee to the starting position.\nHence, the probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}.$\nFinal Answer: The answer is B.
