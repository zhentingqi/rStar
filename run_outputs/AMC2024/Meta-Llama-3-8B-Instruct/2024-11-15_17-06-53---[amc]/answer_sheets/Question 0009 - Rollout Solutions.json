Starting with $n=100$, we perform the operations. If $n$ is not a multiple of 3, then we add 10 to get 110. Otherwise, we divide 100 by 3 to obtain 33.25, so we round down to 33 since we cannot multiply by 3 to get an integer. Therefore, we continue the process.\n\n1. 33 \u2192 11\n2. 11 is not a multiple of 3; we add 10 to get 21.\n3. 21 is not a multiple of 3; we add 10 to get 31.\n4. 31 is not a multiple of 3; we add 10 to get 41.\n5. 41 is not a multiple of 3; we add 10 to get 51.\n6. 51 is not a multiple of 3; we add 10 to get 61.\n7. 61 is not a multiple of 3; we add 10 to get 71.\n8. 71 is not a multiple of 3; we add 10 to get 81.\n9. 81 is not a multiple of 3; we add 10 to get 91.\n10. 91 is not a multiple of 3; we add 10 to get 101.\n\nSince we returned to 101, we know that the cycle repeats. When $n$ is not a multiple of 3, we will always increase $n$ by multiples of 10 until we reach a multiple of 3.
