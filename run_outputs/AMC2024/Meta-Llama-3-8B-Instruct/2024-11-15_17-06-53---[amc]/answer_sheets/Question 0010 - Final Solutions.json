The first question: The regular icosahedron has 12 vertices, 30 edges, and each vertex is connected to 5 others, meaning it's 5-regular. The shortest path between any two vertices (the graph-theoretical distance) ranges between 1 and 3. We are asked to find the probability that $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$ for randomly chosen vertices $Q$, $R$, and $S$. After detailed combinatorial calculations or reference from known results about vertex distances in icosahedrons, it's determined that the probability $P(d(Q, R) > d(R, S))$ is exactly $\\frac{7}{22}$. The answer is A.\n\n2. The second question: A rhombic dodecahedron is a solid with 12 congruent rhombus faces. At every vertex, 3 or 4 edges meet, depending on the vertex. How many vertices have exactly 3 edges meet? It's known that there are 8 vertices with exactly 3 edges meeting, as these vertices correspond to the positions where the shape's faces meet at 120\u00b0 angles, which is characteristic of this structure. The answer is D.\n\n3. The third question: The line segment formed by $A(1, 2)$ and $B(3, 3)$ is rotated to the line segment formed by $A'(3, 1)$ and $B'(4, 3)$ about the point $P(r, s)$. What is $|r-s|$? By observing the points, we can deduce the nature of the rotation. The coordinates of point $P(r, s)$ lie between the midpoints of $A$ and $A'$, and $B$ and $B'$. After solving, we find that $r = 2$ and $s = 1$, resulting in $|r - s| = 1$. The answer is E.\n\n4. The fourth question: How many ordered pairs of integers $(m, n)$ satisfy $\\sqrt{n^2 - 49} = m$? Solving $n^2 - 7^2 = k^2$ for integer $k$, we get $(n+7)(n-7)=k^2$. Therefore, $n+7$ and $n-7$ must both be squares, as they multiply to form $k^2$. By trial-and-error or factorization, we discover that one possible solution pair for $n+7$ and $n-7$ is $(15, 8)$, giving $n=11$, and thus $k=17$.
