There are three possible ways Team A could win the playoff: (i) Win the first game, lose the second game, and win the third game, (ii) Lose the first game, win the second game, and win the third game, and (iii) Win all three games. The probability of case (i) is $(\\frac{1}{3})(\\frac{2}{3})(p) = \\frac{2p}{9}$; the probability of case (ii) is $(\\frac{2}{3})(\\frac{1}{3})(p) = \\frac{2p}{9}$; and the probability of case (iii) is $\\frac{2}{3}p$. Therefore, the total probability of Team A winning the playoff is $\\frac{2p}{9}+\\frac{2p}{9}+(\\frac{2}{3}p) = \\frac{1}{2}.$ Solving this equation for $p$, we get $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}.$ Thus, the value of $m+n$ in our problem is $\\boxed{12}.$\nFinal Answer: The answer is C.

We're given two conditions relating to the probability of Team A winning the playoff. From condition 1, when the playoff takes 2 games, Team A has a chance $\\frac{4}{9}$ of winning. This implies the probability that they lose the second game, given they won the first, is $1-\\frac{4}{9}=\\frac{5}{9}$. Now consider the case where the playoff requires 3 games. There are two possible scenarios: 1. Team A wins the first game and loses the next two, so $p\\cdot(1-p)\\cdot p=\\frac{p^2(1-p)}{p}=\\frac{p-p^2}{1}$; 2. Team A loses the first game and wins the last two, so $(1-p)p^2=(1-p)p$. Setting the sum of these probabilities equal to $\\frac{2}{5}$, we have $$\\frac{p-p^2}{1}+\\frac{(1-p)p}{p}=1\\Rightarrow p=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}.$$This satisfies both conditions, as $\\frac{4}{9}+\\frac{5}{9}=\\frac{9}{9}=1$ and $\\frac{2}{5}=\\frac{8}{15}+\\frac{2}{15}$.
