Given the condition that the product of all numbers equals 60, our goal is to break down 60 into its prime factors: $2^2 * 3 * 5 = 60$. This suggests that the numbers can have factors of 2 squared, 3, or 5, which means they could take on values such as 1, 2, 2, 4, 3, 5, or other combinations involving these prime factors. We need to identify how many times each prime factor appears. Notice that $2^2$ occurs twice, so there might be two numbers having this factor, with one taking value 2 and another taking value 4. There also exists a single number with factor 3, which takes value 3. Finally, there is another single number with factor 5, which takes value 5. With this combination, all prime factors appear once, ensuring the product is indeed 60. Thus, the list of numbers consists of 1, 2, 2, 3, and 5. The answer is E. Final Answer: The answer is E.
