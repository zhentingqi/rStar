The key observation here is that the triangle $APQ$ lies entirely within the triangle $ABC$ when the heights from $A$, $P$, and $Q$ are all shorter than $\\frac{s}{2}$. When the heights are shorter than $\\frac{s}{2}$, then the areas of the triangles will decrease. It follows that the area of $APQ$ is less than half the area of $ABC$ precisely when the lengths of $PA$ and $AQ$ are both shorter than $\\frac{s}{2}$. Therefore, the desired probability is equal to the area of the region where the lines $PA$ and $AQ$ both fall below $\\frac{s}{2}$. This region forms an equilateral triangle of side-length $\\frac{s}{2}$ with area $\\boxed{\\left(\\frac 38, \\frac 12\\right)}.$ The answer is A. Final Answer: The answer is A.
