We want to count the number of ways $J\\cup S$ can be split into three disjoint sets of four people, where each set contains $2$ juniors and $2$ seniors. Here is our approach:\n\nStep 1: Select $2$ juniors and $2$ seniors for the first team. This can be done in $\\binom{6}{2}^2=15^2=225$ ways.\n\nStep 2: Select $2$ juniors and $2$ seniors for the second team from the remaining members. This can be done in $\\binom{4}{2}^2=6^2=36$ ways.\n\nStep 3: Finally, select $2$ juniors and $2$ seniors for the third team from the remaining members. This can be done in $\\binom{2}{2}^2=1^2=1$ way.\n\nStep 4: Multiply all the possible outcomes above to get the total number of possibilities: $225\\times36\\times1=\\boxed{8100}$\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is E.
