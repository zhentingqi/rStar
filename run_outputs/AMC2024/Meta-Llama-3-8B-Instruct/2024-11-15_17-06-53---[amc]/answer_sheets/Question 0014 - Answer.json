{"id": 14, "problem": "Two teams are in a best-two-out-of-three playoff: the teams will play at most $3$ games, and the winner of the playoff is the first team to win $2$ games. The first game is played on Team A's home field, and the remaining games are played on Team B's home field. Team A has a $\\frac{2}{3}$ chance of winning at home, and its probability of winning when playing away from home is $p$. Outcomes of the games are independent. The probability that Team A wins the playoff is $\\frac{1}{2}$. Then $p$ can be written in the form $\\frac{1}{2}(m - \\sqrt{n})$, where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers. What is $m + n$? \n\n$\\textbf{(A) } 10 \\qquad \\textbf{(B) } 11 \\qquad \\textbf{(C) } 12 \\qquad \\textbf{(D) } 13 \\qquad \\textbf{(E) } 14$", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "E", "gold_answer": "E"}
