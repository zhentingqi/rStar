{"id": 21, "problem": "A bee is moving in three-dimensional space. A fair six-sided die with faces labeled $A^+, A^-, B^+, B^-, C^+,$ and $C^-$ is rolled. Suppose the bee occupies the point $(a,b,c).$ If the die shows $A^+$, then the bee moves to the point $(a+1,b,c)$ and if the die shows $A^-,$ then the bee moves to the point $(a-1,b,c).$ Analogous moves are made with the other four outcomes. Suppose the bee starts at the point $(0,0,0)$ and the die is rolled four times. What is the probability that the bee traverses four distinct edges of some unit cube?\n\n$\\textbf{(A) }\\frac{1}{54}\\qquad\\textbf{(B) }\\frac{7}{54}\\qquad\\textbf{(C) }\\frac{1}{6}\\qquad\\textbf{(D) }\\frac{5}{18}\\qquad\\textbf{(E) }\\frac{2}{5}$", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "B", "gold_answer": "B"}
