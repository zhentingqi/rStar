In this case, the sequence generated will contain $4k+1$ numbers starting with $i$ for some integer $k$. Similar reasoning reveals that $0 < k < 509$, so $0 < i < 2048$, and thus $i \\leqslant 2036$. Considering both cases, we find that the maximum number of elements in $S$ occurs when $i$ is even, giving $2025$ total elements.
