Solving these equations for $a$ and $d$, we get $a = -3d$ and $b = 2d$. Substituting them back into $a + b + c = 0$ yields $c = -d$. Since $c$ is in between $a$ and $b$, we have $-d < -3d < 2d$. The only value of $d$ satisfying this condition is $d = -6$. From here, we have $a = 18, b = -12, c = 12$.
