Induction Step: To prove that $N_{k+1} = N_k/3^{a_{k+1}}$ holds for all $k$, consider three cases based on the remainder when dividing $N_k$ by $3$: (i) $N_k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$: In this case, $N_{k+1} = N_k / 3 = N_k / 3^{a_k+1}$; thus, the induction hypothesis holds. (ii) $N_k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$: This implies that $N_{k+1} = N_k + 10 = N_k (1 + 3^{\\lfloor k/3 \\rfloor + 1}) = N_k (3^{\\lfloor k/3 \\rfloor + 2} - 3^{\\lfloor k/3 \\rfloor + 1}) = N_k \\cdot 3^{a_{k+1} + 1} - N_k \\cdot 3^{a_{k+1}} = N_k/3^{a_{k+1}} - (N_k/3^{a_{k+1}})/3 = N_k/3^{a_{k+1}}$, again verifying the induction hypothesis. (iii) $N_k \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$: Similarly, in this case $N_{k+1} = N_k + 10 = N_k (1 + 3^{\\lfloor k/3 \\rfloor + 1}) = N_k (3^{\\lfloor k/3 \\rfloor + 2} - 3^{\\lfloor k/3 \\rfloor + 1}) = N_k \\cdot 3^{a_{k+1} + 1} - N_k \\cdot 3^{a_{k+1}} = N_k/3^{a_{k+1}} - (N_k/3^{a_{k+1}})/3 = N_k/3^{a_{k+1}}$, confirming the induction hypothesis once more. Therefore, the claim is established by strong induction. Finally, applying this method for $k = 100$, it follows that $N_{100} = N_0/3^{a_{100}} = 100/3^{33}$.
