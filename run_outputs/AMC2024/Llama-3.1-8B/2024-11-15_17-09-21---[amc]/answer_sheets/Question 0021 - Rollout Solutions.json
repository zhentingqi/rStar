Consider a single roll of the die. For each move after the initial position (0, 0, 0), there are two possibilities: the bee moves to another location (e.g., (+1, 0, 0) to (+1, 0, 0)) or returns to its original location (e.g., (+1, 0, 0) to (0, 0, 0)). With equal probability, the bee could move anywhere along each axis (+1, 0, 0), (-1, 0, 0), etc. However, since the question asks specifically for distinct locations traversed, let's consider cases where the bee does not return to its starting point. There are 6 possible moves that don't send the bee back to its starting position: (+1, 0, 0), (-1, 0, 0), (0, +1, 0), (0, -1, 0), (0, 0, +1), (0, 0, -1). Each case occurs with equal probability, and the total probability of not returning to the starting position is 6/6=1. Then, the probability of returning to the starting position after the first roll is 1/6. The same argument applies for the next three rolls, so the overall probability of not repeating any edge is $(1/6)^4=\\frac{1}{1296}$. The answer is E.", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
