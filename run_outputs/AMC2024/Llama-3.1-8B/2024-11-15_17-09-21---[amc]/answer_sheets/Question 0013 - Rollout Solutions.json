From the first equation, we can derive that $m=x^2-k-1213$. Plugging this back in to the second equation, we obtain $x^2-k-1213+k+3773=y^2$. Rearranging, we get $x^2+y^2=2k+1260$. This tells us that $k$ must be an odd number, since otherwise $x^2+y^2$ would be even. Then, let $k=2u+1$ for some non-negative integer $u$. Now, $y^2=x^2+(2u+1)=x^2+2ux+u^2+1=(x+u)^2+1$, so $y>x+u$. Since $y^2$ is also greater than $x^2$, we conclude that $y>x+u>\\frac{x+y}{2}>x$. Finally, $k=2u+1<2(x+u)+1=2x+2u+1=y-x$, hence $y-x>k$.
