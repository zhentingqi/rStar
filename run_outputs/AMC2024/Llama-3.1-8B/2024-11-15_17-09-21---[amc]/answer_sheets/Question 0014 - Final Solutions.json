Because the first team to win $2$ games wins the playoff, it doesn't matter how many more chances the losing team gets after the other team already won twice; all that matters is whether or not the losing team has enough time to win another game before the opposing team reaches $2$ wins. Therefore, the probability of Team A winning the playoff depends solely on the probability of Team A winning the first two games. There is a $\\frac{1}{4}$ chance that Team A wins the first two games, a $\\frac{1}{2}$ chance that Team A wins the first game, forcing a second game, followed by a $\\frac{1}{3}$ chance that Team A wins the second game, a $\\frac{1}{4}$ chance that Team A wins neither of the first two games, making the playoff result dependent on the outcome of the third and final game, and a $\\frac{1}{8}$ chance that Team A wins both of the first two games, making the playoff result again dependent on the outcome of the third and final game. Using the above probabilities, the overall probability of Team A winning the playoff is calculated to be $\\frac{\\frac{1}{4}}{\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{2}}=\\frac{1}{2}$, or $50 \\%$.
