It\u2019s observed that both persons $2$ and $3$ require 3 times more time than person $1$ to complete 1 packet. Thus, after $t$ minutes of work, they produce a total of $[T_2(t)] = [T_3(t)] = t/3$ packets. Therefore, the total number of packets produced is $P(t) = T_1(t) + T_2(t) + T_3(t) = T_1(t) + 2t/3$. As noted, $T_1(t)$ increases at a rate of 4 packets every 3 minutes. This corresponds to an initial rate of 4/3 packets per minute. The number of packets completed follows a linear function, with slope 4/3. Substituting this into the expression above yields $P(t) = 4t/3 + 2t/3 = 2t$. From here, it can be concluded that $P(22) = 44$. The answer is B.", "value": 0.2}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Given Condition 1, let $T_1(t)$ denote the number of packets done by person $1$ after $t$ minutes of work, and similarly, $T_2(t), T_3(t)$ denote the corresponding numbers for persons $2$ and $3$. It\u2019s observed that both persons $2$ and $3$ require 3 times more time than person $1$ to complete 1 packet. Thus, after $t$ minutes of work, they produce a total of $[T_2(t)] = [T_3(t)] = t/3$ packets. Therefore, the total number of packets produced is $P(t) = T_1(t) + T_2(t) + T_3(t) = T_1(t) + 2t/3$.
