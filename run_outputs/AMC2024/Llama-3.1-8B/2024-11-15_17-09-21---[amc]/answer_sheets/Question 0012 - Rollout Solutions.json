Note that if $\\ell = 2$, then the length of $BC$ would be less than the sum of $AB$ and $OA$.", "4": "Thus, the correct solution is when $\\ell = 16$ units and $AO = 12 \\sqrt{3} - 24 - 16 = 12 \\sqrt{3} - 40$ units. Next, note that if we connect $CO$ and $AO$, they form a right angle. Also, let the intersecting point of lines $CO$ and $AO$ be called $T$.", "5": "Now, imagine rolling a ball towards the equilateral triangle until it reaches the circle. As the ball rolls, it traces out a cone whose base is the entire area under consideration. Denote the base of the cone by $Q$, the top of the cone by $S$, and the circle by $K$. Then, $K$ touches $Q$ only at the topmost part of $Q$, forming two identical cones. Using similar triangles, we know that $\\angle SOT = \\angle OCT = 90^\\circ$, and thus, triangles $COA$ and $TSO$ are similar. It follows that $\\frac{SO}{OC} = \\frac{TO}{SA} \\Rightarrow \\frac{TO}{20} = \\frac{16 \\sqrt{3}}{12 \\sqrt{3} - 40} \\Rightarrow TO = \\frac{320}{27}$. Lastly, we use similarity again to solve for the total area of $Q$ minus the circular sector $K$. Denoting the area of $Q$ as $W$, we see that $\\triangle TSO$ is similar to $\\triangle AOI$ (the smaller triangle). It follows that $\\frac{WO}{WS} = \\frac{TQ}{AI} \\Rightarrow \\frac{20}{WS} = \\frac{\\frac{320}{27}}{12 \\sqrt{3}} \\Rightarrow WS = \\frac{27}{4}$.
