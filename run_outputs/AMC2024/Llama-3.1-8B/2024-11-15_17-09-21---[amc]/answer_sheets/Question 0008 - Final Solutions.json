Consider the following cases for pairing within a team: 1. Pairing within a group of $j_i$: This can be done in ${4 \\choose 2} = 6$ ways. 2. Pairing within a group of $s_i$: Similar to the previous case, it can also be done in ${4 \\choose 2} = 6$ ways. 3. Pairing between groups of $j_i$ and $s_i$ within the same team: This can be done in ${2 \\choose 1}^2 * {2 \\choose 1}^2 = 16$ ways. Overall, the number of possible pairings within a team is $6 + 6 + 16 = 28$. Thus, the total number of ways to pair $12$ students into $3$ teams is $28^3 = 21952$.

The problem involves distributing teachers among students and ensuring that different students don't receive the same teacher. One way to approach this is through permutations.
